# AdventOfCode2023
Advent of Code is a yearly programming event where small, two part puzzles are uploaded daily from
December 1st to December 25th (like an Advent calendar!). The event was created and is maintained by Eric Wastl, check out the website [here](https://adventofcode.com)! <br/>

This year I am attempting all of the puzzles in Kotlin, in order to get some more experience with the language. 

## Completed
I completed Advent of Code 2023 on June 30th, 2024!
